The shift to cloud computing involves a veritable plethora of new technologies and approaches. From 12 factors to domain driven design, change is afoot. Your organization is knee deep in functions and platforms and containers and while the technology is important, we can’t afford to overlook the importance of culture. What changes when we go to the cloud? How do we get there? How does Conways law affect the success of our efforts? How can we help people navigate the latest evolution in computing? This talk will explore how cloud native computing impacts more than just our architecture.
