I always enjoy chatting with [Cote](https://cote.io) - and apparently many people do as well! Our [conversation](https://soundcloud.com/pivotalconversations/knate-ive) about [Knative](https://pivotal.io/knative), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and more is, [according to the one and only Dormain Drewitz](https://twitter.com/DormainDrewitz/status/1223313491156557824), number 2 on the Top Pivotal Conversations episodes of 2019!

I'm pretty sure Cote brings his podcasting equipment _everywhere_ and you can even find him and I discussing [12 Factor apps](/publication/pivotal-convo-98/) (and undead sculptures) as well as talking about [ops at SpringOne Tour Istanbul](/publication/piv-conv-istanbul-pod/) along with the one and only [Paul Czarkowski](https://twitter.com/pczarkowski).
