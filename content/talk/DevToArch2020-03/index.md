location: O'Reilly Online
summary: Software developers often long to upgrade their careers by becoming software architects. But many don't realize that although the job title suggests a work day focused on technical decision making, the reality is quite different. Over two days, Nathaniel Schutta details the skills you need for success in the real world, where communication trumps coding, as he walks you through what it means to be a successful architect.
abstract: Discover the skill sets needed to juggle multiple priorities, meetings, and time demands. Learn why your best team leadership tool is not a hammer, but a shared cup of coffee. Hear the best ways to give and take criticism. Understand the necessity of writing effective email and formal architecture documents. Get tips for delivering confident career-building presentations to any audience. Review essential techniques for stakeholder management and relationship building. Explore the critical needs for architecture reviews and an effective process for conducting them. Through lecture and small group exercises, Nathaniel will help you understand what it means to be a successful architect. Working through various problems, attendees will have opportunities to think through architectural decisions and patterns, discuss the importance of non functional requirements and why architects cannot afford to practice resume driven design.
