abstract: "Developers focus on functional requirements, but once you step into the architect role, your world is increasingly inhabited by the '-ilities'—the nonfunctional or quality attributes of a software system. But which '-ilities' matter and which don't? Nathaniel Schutta explores approaches to architectural problems and explains how to best document the inevitable decisions we arrive at."
