abstract: "New software technology appears every year. Like clockwork, another language, library, pattern, or approach will arrive on the scene with plenty of hype and developer enthusiasm. As someone whose job requires making architectural decisions, you need to evaluate these new technologies with an eye toward the inevitable tradeoffs before deciding if a new framework or language is right for your project."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Michael Carducci and Nate Schutta sit down to talk about how to approach software architecture and mastery of the craft of software development. Check out Nateâ€™s [latest publication](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/thinking-architecturally)."
