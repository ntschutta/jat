abstract: "Part of what defines an application as cloud native is an application and management style described by the 12 factors. While these seem simple at first, each of them just the top of the iceberg of recommendations. Cot√© plumbs the depths with Nate Schutta to see what's under the waterline. They also discuss where state is in this stateless model and how it's managed."
