abstract: "New software technology appears every year. Like clockwork, another language, library, pattern, or approach will arrive on the  scene with plenty of hype and developer enthusiasm. As someone whose job requires making architectural decisions, you need to evaluate these new technologies with an eye toward the inevitable tradeoffs before deciding if a new framework or language is right for your project."

I'm [very excited to announce](https://twitter.com/ntschutta/status/997184365363843073) my latest book project, Thinking Architecturally, is [now available](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/thinking-architecturally)! My thoughts on being an architect, dealing w/ change, etc. If youâ€™ve attended one of my talks in the last few years, you will recognize some of the material. The reception has been beyond my expectations and I am delighted by the responses I've received from people that have read the book. If you are interested in perusing the material, it is a [free download](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/thinking-architecturally) from the [Pivotal Resource center](https://content.pivotal.io/resources). Enjoy and please reach out with feedback!
