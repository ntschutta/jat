abstract: "This week I've got a discussion about DevOps I had with Nate and Paul. I've been curious about the changing nature of DevOps as SRE and platform operations comes into vogue. It seems like the idea of full stack DevOps is being dimension...and maybe DevOps itself? Maybe now it's just OpsOps. We also talk about enterprise architecture and governance in the age of decoupled, event-driven, microservices. And somewhere in there, we talk about how culture gets changed and who needs to do it.

We discuss!

This was one of the Pivotal Conversations talks at SpringOne Tour in Istanbul done at a table in the lunch room, with about 8 attendees. I've cut out most of the attendee interaction to keep their stuff off the record. And pardon the background noise, I've tried to remove as much as possible without distorting the entr√©e audio."
